.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fB(BETA)\fR This command sets the policy for the Managed VMs of the given
modules and version. When your module uses VM runtimes, you can use this command
to change the management mode for a set of your VMs. If you switch to
self\-managed, SSH will be enabled on the VMs, and they will be removed from the
health checking pools, but will still receive requests. When you switch back to
Google\-managed mode, any local changes on the VMs are lost and they are
restarted and added back into the normal pools.
