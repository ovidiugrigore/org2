.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute operations list\fR displays all Google Compute Engine
operations in a project.

By default, global operations and operations from all regions are listed. The
results can be narrowed down by providing the \f5\fI\-\-regions\fR\fR or
\f5\fI\-\-global\fR\fR flag.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

[\fINAME\fR ...]
.RS 2m
If provided, show details for the specified names and/or URIs of resources.


.RE

.SH "FLAGS"

\fB\-\-global\fR
.RS 2m
If provided, only global resources are shown.

.RE
\fB\-\-limit\fR \fILIMIT\fR
.RS 2m
The maximum number of results.

.RE
\fB\-\-regexp\fR \fIREGEXP\fR, \fB\-r\fR \fIREGEXP\fR
.RS 2m
A regular expression to filter the names of the results on. Any names that do
not match the entire regular expression will be filtered out.

.RE
\fB\-\-regions\fR [\fIREGION\fR,...]
.RS 2m
If provided, only regional resources are shown. If arguments are provided, only
resources from the given regions are shown.

.RE
\fB\-\-sort\-by\fR \fISORT_BY\fR
.RS 2m
A field to sort by. To perform a descending\-order sort, prefix the value of
this flag with a tilde (``~'').

.RE
\fB\-\-uri\fR
.RS 2m
If provided, the list command will only print URIs for the resources returned.
If this flag is not provided, the list command will print a human\-readable
table of useful resource data.

.RE
\fB\-\-zones\fR [\fIZONE\fR,...]
.RS 2m
If provided, only zonal resources are shown. If arguments are provided, only
resources from the given zones are shown.


.RE

.SH "GLOBAL FLAGS"

Run \fB$ gcloud help\fR for a description of flags available to all commands.
