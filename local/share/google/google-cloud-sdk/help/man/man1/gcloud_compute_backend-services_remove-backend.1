\f5gcloud compute backend\-services remove\-backend\fR \fINAME\fR [\fB\-\-group\fR\ \fIGROUP\fR\ |\ \fB\-\-instance\-group\fR\ \fIINSTANCE_GROUP\fR] [\fB\-\-zone\fR\ \fIZONE\fR] [\fIGLOBAL\-FLAG\ ...\fR]


.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute backend\-services remove\-backend\fR is used to remove a
backend from a backend service.

Before removing a backend, it is a good idea to "drain" the backend first. A
backend can be drained by setting its capacity scaler to zero through 'gcloud
compute backend\-services edit'.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

\fINAME\fR
.RS 2m
The name of the backend service.


.RE

.SH "FLAGS"

\fB\-\-group\fR \fIGROUP\fR
.RS 2m
The name of the legacy instance group (deprecated resourceViews API) to remove.
Use \-\-instance\-group flag instead.

.RE
\fB\-\-instance\-group\fR \fIINSTANCE_GROUP\fR
.RS 2m
The name or URI of the instance group to remove.

.RE
\fB\-\-zone\fR \fIZONE\fR
.RS 2m
The zone of the instance group to remove from the backend service. If not
specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
\f5\fIcompute/zone\fR\fR property:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.RE

A list of zones can be fetched by running:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud compute zones list
.RE

To unset the property, run:

.RS 2m
$ gcloud config unset compute/zone
.RE

Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
\f5\fICLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\fR\fR.
