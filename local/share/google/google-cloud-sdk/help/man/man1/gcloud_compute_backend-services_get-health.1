gcloud compute backend\-services get\-health \- get backend health statuses from a backend service



.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP
\f5gcloud compute backend\-services get\-health\fR \fINAME\fR [\fIGLOBAL\-FLAG\ ...\fR]


.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fBgcloud compute backend\-services get\-health\fR is used to request the
current health status of instances in a backend service. Every group in the
service is checked and the health status of each configured instance is printed.

If a group contains names of instances that don't exist or instances that
haven't yet been pushed to the load\-balancing system, they will not show up.
Those that are listed as \f5\fIHEALTHY\fR\fR are able to receive load\-balanced
traffic. Those that are marked as \f5\fIUNHEALTHY\fR\fR are either failing the
configured health\-check or not responding to it.

Since the health checks are performed continuously and in a distributed manner,
the state returned by this command is the most recent result of a vote of
several redundant health checks. Backend services that do not have a valid
global forwarding rule referencing it will not be health checked and so will
have no health status.



.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"

\fINAME\fR
.RS 2m
The name of the backend service.
