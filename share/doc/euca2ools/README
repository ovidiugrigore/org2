Euca2ools are command line tools used to interact with Amazon Web
Services (AWS) as well as other services that are compatible with AWS,
such as Eucalyptus.  They aim to use the same input as similar tools
provided by AWS for each service individually along with several
enhancements that make them easier to use against both AWS and
Eucalyptus.

Euca2ools provide the functionality of AWS's REST-based and Query-based
APIs for the following services:

- Auto Scaling           (2011-01-01) (commands start with "euscale")
- CloudFormation         (2010-05-15) (commands start with "euform")
- CloudWatch             (2010-08-01) (commands start with "euwatch")
- EC2                    (2013-02-01) (commands start with "euca")
- Elastic Load Balancing (2012-06-01) (commands start with "eulb")
- IAM                    (2010-05-08) (commands start with "euare")

The source code comes with man pages that provide basic documentation.
Running a command with --help will also provide information on how to
use that specific command.  For more detailed documentation, see the
online euca2ools documentation:  http://www.eucalyptus.com/docs

For installation instructions, consult the INSTALL file that accompanies
the source code.
